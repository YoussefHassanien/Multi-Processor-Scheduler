# Overview 
This project showcases our knowledge of data structures such as queues, stacks, and trees. 
It is a simulation of a multiprocessor schedular where we implemented 4 scheduling algorithms that are: FCFS, SJF, RR, EDF. 
The scheduler works in a way that keeps the CPU busy as possible and minimize response time and waiting time for processes being scheduled.
We also perform calculations related statistics such as load and utilization of each processor, the stolen processes, and the killed processes.
